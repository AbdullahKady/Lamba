Parts missing in the re-design of the article viewing page:

* Accessing the profile images of the author, commenters and repliers 
* Accessing the about information of the author
* Adding to the favorites once it's implemnted.



TODO:

- Each component should make sure all features are integrated correctly and nothing is missing (functioning) (if you find a problem please fix it)
- TEST ALL FEATURES AGAIN
- Create a template for the view (FrontEnd)
- Change all the hardcoded data after fixing the login (using session variables)
- Beautify input tags (dropdown).
- Work on the design of the post component, and fix it's tags.
- Do some proper notifications (noty hopefully).

Notes: 

* Edited the show reply, outsourced into a method to close all other open replies (in the single article component).
