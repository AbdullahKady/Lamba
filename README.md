Fully Integrated
FrontEnd & BackEnd --Working

Problems & Bugs (Not Related to the Integration):
- STOREE (Bugs and NOT Compiling : QuillModule ) //Code is integreted but commented (Not Working)
- Post component needs to check the "Safe-HTML" pipe (needs to be re-done.. HTML is commented and throws an error)
- Login Username & Password required (provided)

TODO:
- Each component should make sure all features are integrated correctly and nothing is missing (functioning) (if you find a problem please fix it)
- TEST ALL FEATURES AGAIN
- Create a template for the view (FrontEnd)
- Change all the hardcoded data after fixing the login (using session variables)
